### **What Changes Were Made?**

1. **Reduced Factors**:
   - The number of latent factors tested (`n_factors`) is explicitly set to `[1, 2]` using the `factor_counts` list.
   - This ensures that the IPCA model is run separately for configurations with **1 factor** and **2 factors**, allowing us to compare their performance in explaining variance.

2. **Variance Explained Calculation**:
   - The variance explained by the latent factors is computed for each fold, and results are stored for both configurations.
   - This helps us understand how the number of factors impacts the explanatory power of the model.

3. **Updated Visualizations**:
   - Separate heatmaps are generated for the Gamma matrix (\( \Gamma \)) for both configurations, showcasing how characteristics load onto the factors.
   - A comparison plot is created to display the variance explained across folds for 1 factor versus 2 factors.

### 1. **Gamma Matrix Heatmap - Fold 5 (1 Factor)** (`gamma_heatmap_fold_5_1_factors.png`)

![gamma_heatmap_fold_5_1_factors](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/ipca/blob/main/real_data/plots1/gamma_heatmap_fold_5_1_factors.png)

**Description**:
- This heatmap shows the Gamma matrix for Fold 5 with 1 latent factor. The rows represent the characteristics (volatility, MA ratio, price-MA ratio, and volume), and the single column (Factor 0) represents the latent factor.
- The values in the heatmap indicate the strength and direction (positive or negative) of each characteristic's contribution to the latent factor.

**Interpretation**:
- **Characteristic 2 (Price-MA Ratio)** has the strongest positive loading (0.72) on the single latent factor. This suggests that short-term price movements relative to moving averages heavily influence this factor.
- **Characteristic 0 (Volatility)** has a moderately negative loading (-0.47), indicating that volatility negatively contributes to the factor.
- **Characteristics 1 (MA Ratio)** and **3 (Volume)** also contribute to the factor but with lower magnitudes.
- Overall, this heatmap suggests that the latent factor in Fold 5 is driven primarily by the Price-MA Ratio, with some influence from volatility.

### 2. **Gamma Matrix Heatmap - Fold 5 (2 Factors)** (`gamma_heatmap_fold_5_2_factors.png`)

![gamma_heatmap_fold_5_2_factors](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/ipca/blob/main/real_data/plots1/gamma_heatmap_fold_5_2_factors.png)

**Description**:
- This heatmap displays the Gamma matrix for Fold 5 with 2 latent factors. Rows represent characteristics, and columns represent the two latent factors (Factor 0 and Factor 1).
- The values show the strength and direction of each characteristic's contribution to each factor.

**Interpretation**:
- **Factor 0**:
  - **Characteristic 2 (Price-MA Ratio)** has the strongest positive loading (0.75), making it the primary driver of this factor.
  - **Characteristic 3 (Volume)** also contributes positively (0.42), indicating its secondary importance in Factor 0.
- **Factor 1**:
  - **Characteristic 0 (Volatility)** has a high positive loading (0.73), suggesting that this factor captures risk-related dynamics in stock returns.
  - **Characteristic 1 (MA Ratio)** contributes moderately (0.45), indicating its influence on long-term trends.
- The heatmap highlights the division of labor between the two factors: Factor 0 focuses on short-term price deviations (Price-MA Ratio), while Factor 1 emphasizes risk and trend metrics (Volatility and MA Ratio).

### 3. **Variance Explained by Factors Across Folds** (`variance_explained_comparison.png`)

![variance_explained_comparison](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/ipca/blob/main/real_data/plots1/variance_explained_comparison.png)

**Description**:
- This line plot compares the percentage of variance in stock returns explained by 1 vs. 2 latent factors across all 5 folds.
- The x-axis represents the fold number, and the y-axis shows the proportion of variance explained (%).

**Interpretation**:
- The orange line (2 factors) consistently explains more variance than the blue line (1 factor) across all folds, as expected since adding a second factor increases the model's flexibility.
- The variance explained by 2 factors peaks at Fold 4 (~0.8%), while 1 factor peaks at Fold 3 (~0.4%). However, the overall proportion of variance explained remains low in both cases, suggesting that the selected characteristics capture only a small fraction of stock return variability.
- This result emphasizes the complexity of financial return data, where other unobserved factors likely play a significant role.

### 4. **Variance Explained Summary** (`variance_explained_summary.csv`)

**Description**:
- This CSV file contains a summary of the variance explained by 1 and 2 factors across all folds.
- The columns include:
  - **Factors**: Number of latent factors (1 or 2).
  - **Avg_Variance_Explained**: The average percentage of variance explained across all folds.
  - **Variance_Explained_Per_Fold**: A list of variance explained values for each fold.

**Interpretation**:
- The CSV allows for a direct comparison between the average performance of 1 vs. 2 factors:
  - **1 Factor**: Explains ~0.3-0.4% variance on average.
  - **2 Factors**: Explains ~0.6-0.8% variance on average, showing a clear improvement over 1 factor.
- While 2 factors perform better, the overall explained variance remains low, suggesting that additional characteristics or alternative modeling techniques might be needed to capture more of the variability in returns.

### **5. Aligned Error Heatmap (1 Factor)**

![aligned_error_heatmap_1_factors](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/ipca/blob/main/real_data/plots1/aligned_error_heatmap_1_factors.png)

**Description**:
- This heatmap displays the aligned errors between factor loadings across folds after Procrustes alignment with **1 latent factor**.
- Each cell represents the Frobenius norm (a measure of difference) between the Gamma matrices of two folds after alignment.
- Diagonal values are zero because a fold is perfectly aligned with itself.

**Interpretation**:
- The low values across most cells (e.g., ~0.10â€“0.15) suggest that alignment significantly improves consistency between factor loadings across folds.
- Slightly higher errors are observed for Fold 1 vs. Fold 4 (0.15) and Fold 1 vs. Fold 3 (0.15), indicating these pairs are less consistent, even after alignment.
- Overall, alignment has successfully reduced discrepancies, ensuring that the latent factor is interpreted consistently across time.

### **9. Unaligned Error Heatmap (1 Factor)**

![unaligned_error_heatmap_1_factors](https://github.com/aditya-saxena-7/ipca/blob/main/real_data/plots1/unaligned_error_heatmap_1_factors.png)

**Description**:
- This heatmap displays the unaligned errors between Gamma matrices across folds for **1 latent factor** before alignment.
- Errors represent the raw differences in factor loadings without accounting for rotation or scaling.

**Interpretation**:
- Errors are relatively high (~3.9 for most fold pairs), showing significant discrepancies between Gamma matrices before alignment.
- These high unaligned errors confirm the need for Procrustes alignment to standardize the factor loadings across folds.

---

### **10. Unaligned Error Heatmap (2 Factors)**

### **Overall Insights**

The updated results and visualizations provide deeper clarity into the effects of reducing the number of factors and the effectiveness of Procrustes alignment in improving the consistency of factor loadings across folds. Here are the **key takeaways**:

---

#### **1. Reduced Factors Improve Interpretability**
- **1 Factor**:
  - The single-factor model focuses primarily on short-term price deviations (Price-MA Ratio), as evidenced by strong loadings on this characteristic.
  - Simpler models, like 1 factor, tend to have lower overall error after alignment, highlighting their interpretability and robustness.
  - Variance explained is low (~0.3â€“0.4% on average), but the model is more stable across folds.

- **2 Factors**:
  - Adding a second factor increases flexibility, capturing additional dynamics such as risk (Volatility) and long-term trends (MA Ratio).
  - Variance explained improves (~0.6â€“0.8% on average), showing that the second factor adds explanatory power.
  - However, the complexity increases, resulting in higher alignment errors compared to the single-factor model.

---

#### **2. Procrustes Alignment Reduces Errors Effectively**
- Across both 1 and 2-factor configurations, Procrustes alignment significantly reduces discrepancies in factor loadings across folds.
- **1 Factor**:
  - Alignment reduces unaligned errors (~3.9 across fold pairs) to very low aligned errors (~0.1â€“0.15), improving consistency significantly.
  - Percentage improvement is as high as **97%** for certain fold comparisons, confirming the alignment process is highly effective.
- **2 Factors**:
  - Alignment still reduces errors but less effectively than for 1 factor. Aligned errors remain around **0.65â€“1.5**, reflecting the increased complexity of interpreting two factors.
  - Percentage improvement varies (~75â€“94%) across most pairs, with occasional misalignments suggesting structural differences between folds.

---

#### **3. Characteristics and Factor Contributions**
- **Gamma Matrix Insights**:
  - **1 Factor**: The single latent factor is primarily driven by **Price-MA Ratio** with some influence from Volatility, suggesting it reflects short-term price deviations and risk.
  - **2 Factors**: 
    - **Factor 0** is driven by Price-MA Ratio and Volume, capturing short-term trends and trading activity.
    - **Factor 1** is driven by Volatility and MA Ratio, emphasizing risk and long-term trend dynamics.

---

#### **4. Trade-Off Between Complexity and Consistency**
- **Simplicity of 1 Factor**:
  - The 1-factor model is simpler and achieves greater consistency across folds. Lower alignment errors and high percentage improvements make it a more robust choice when interpretability is prioritized.
- **Flexibility of 2 Factors**:
  - Adding a second factor improves the explanatory power of the model but increases complexity. This introduces more variability in factor loadings across folds, requiring greater reliance on alignment to achieve consistency.

---

#### **5. Variance Explained Remains Low**
- Despite improvements with 2 factors, the variance explained by the model remains low (~0.6â€“0.8% on average), indicating that the chosen characteristics (Volatility, MA Ratio, Price-MA Ratio, and Volume) capture only a small portion of return variability.
- This suggests that other latent dynamics or unobserved factors may play a significant role in explaining stock returns.
