### Alignment Verification and Error Analysis

To compare the estimated $\Gamma$ and true $\Gamma^*$ values and analyze alignment errors, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Alignment Error**: Compute $\| \Gamma - \Gamma^* \|^2$ for each configuration of $N$ and $\sigma^2$. This is already done, but to analyze trends, aggregate these errors across noise levels or sample sizes separately.

2. **Rotational Ambiguity Check**: Since factor models can be rotationally invariant, the estimated $\Gamma$ might be rotated compared to $\Gamma^*$. This can cause misalignment, making it challenging to interpret the difference as an actual error. Procrustes Analysis can address this.

### Implementing Procrustes Analysis for Alignment Correction

**Procrustes Analysis** aligns two matrices (e.g., $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^*$) by finding the best rotation, scaling, and reflection that minimizes the discrepancy between them. This will help to verify if the differences observed in $|\Gamma - \Gamma^*|$ are due to rotational ambiguity or genuine estimation error.

#### Steps for Procrustes Analysis

1. **Standardize**: Ensure both $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^*$ have zero mean. Centering can help remove any translation differences.

2. **Apply Procrustes Transformation**:
   - Calculate the optimal rotation matrix $R$ that aligns $\Gamma$ to $\Gamma^*$ by solving the Procrustes problem:

     $$
     \min_{R} \| \Gamma R - \Gamma^* \|_F
     $$

     where $\| \cdot \|_F$ denotes the Frobenius norm, and $R$ is an orthogonal matrix (i.e., $R^T R = I$).
   - This can be done using singular value decomposition (SVD) on $\Gamma^*^T \Gamma$.

3. **Transform**: Rotate the estimated $\Gamma$ using $R$ to get $\Gamma_{\text{aligned}} = \Gamma R$.

4. **Evaluate Alignment**: Calculate $\| \Gamma_{\text{aligned}} - \Gamma^* \|$. If this aligned error is significantly lower than the unaligned error, it suggests that rotational ambiguity was impacting the results. Otherwise, the observed error likely stems from model limitations or noise effects.

By implementing these steps, you should be able to determine whether the discrepancies in $|\Gamma - \Gamma^*|$ are due to alignment issues or if they reflect limitations of the IPCA model under the given conditions.
